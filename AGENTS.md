# Agent Guidelines

- Prefer placing new high-level documentation in the `docs/` directory.
- Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) fenced code blocks for flowcharts or sequence diagrams in Markdown files so they can render in GitHub.
- Keep line lengths in Markdown under 120 characters for readability, and wrap paragraphs accordingly.
- When describing npm-based workflows, reference the exact scripts defined in `package.json`.
